/*
Write an SQL query to find for each user, whether the brand of the second item (by date) they sold is their favorite brand. If a user sold less than two items, report the answer for that user as no.

It is guaranteed that no seller sold more than one item on a day.

The query result format is in the following example:

Users table:
+---------+------------+----------------+
| user_id | join_date  | favorite_brand |
+---------+------------+----------------+
| 1       | 2019-01-01 | Lenovo         |
| 2       | 2019-02-09 | Samsung        |
| 3       | 2019-01-19 | LG             |
| 4       | 2019-05-21 | HP             |
+---------+------------+----------------+

Orders table:
+----------+------------+---------+----------+-----------+
| order_id | order_date | item_id | buyer_id | seller_id |
