In social network like Facebook or Twitter, people send friend requests and accept othersâ€™ requests as well. Now given two tables as below:
 

Table: friend_request
| sender_id | send_to_id |request_date|
|-----------|------------|------------|
| 1         | 2          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 3          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 4          | 2016_06-01 |
| 2         | 3          | 2016_06-02 |
| 3         | 4          | 2016-06-09 |
 

Table: request_accepted
| requester_id | accepter_id |accept_date |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-10 |
 

Write a query to find the overall acceptance rate of requests rounded to 2 decimals, which is the number of acceptance divide the number of requests.
 

For the sample data above, your query should return the following result.
 

|accept_rate|
|-----------|
|       0.80|
*/

/*
logic: return sum of distinct acceptance / sum of distinct friend request
sum of distinct acceptance: count distinct requester_id and accepter_id
sum of distinct friend request: count distinct sender_id and send_to_id
*/

SELECT 
ROUND(
    IFNULL(
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id FROM request_accepted) AS accepted)
    / 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id FROM friend_request) 
     AS total), 0), 2) AS accept_rate;
