+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 6           |
| 3           | 5           |
| 3           | 6           |
| 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+

Product table:
+-------------+
| product_key |
+-------------+
| 5           |
| 6           |
+-------------+

Result table:

| customer_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |

SELECT customer_id
FROM (SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) AS product_count
      FROM Customer 
      GROUP BY customer_id) AS aggregated_table
WHERE product_count = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) FROM Customer)
